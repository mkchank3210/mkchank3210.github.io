        <h1>Journey to Becoming a Programmer</h1>
        <p>Routinely captured thoughts to remind me what I've done and keep a record of this journey.</p>
        <p>I opened this part of my site on 22 March 2025. I started self-teaching around February 2025.</p>
        <p>In terms of web development all I know is html right now, so this is a BASIC page written all in
            HTML till I learn more basic techniques.</p>

            <h3>Significant Events</h3>
            <ul class="sigEvents-list">
                <li>Started a project specficiation document for my Daily Organizer Web App.</li>
                <li>Parallel learning the css and js freeCodeCamp courses.</li>
                <li>Started using Copilot AI to dicsuss how to make my app.</li>

            </ul>
            <h3>Thoughts</h3>
            <div class="thought-entry">I have started a document to track my thoughts and ideas on what I want my first
                personal app for learning. I refined
                the requirements by discussing these details with the general online Copilot AI (not in GitHub of
                VScode).
                I worked out the tech stack for my app this way. Frontend: vue.js; Backend: node.js; storage: SQLite; and authentication: Firebase.
                I know it's ambitious because I'm still just learning css and js, but I'll just need to take it
                methodically. I have no timeline
                so can take my time to learn what I need to know.
                <p>I could not wait to work on the js course because the css course is very long. I really wanted to
                    start learning js.</p>
                <p>I forgot to add in my last entry that the To-Do List I made helped me understand how to use localStorage with webapps.
                    Reviewing localStorage capabilities with Copilot I understand that its limited in size and local to the browser being used.
                    I will need to use something like SQLite or MongoDB to store data for my app.</p>
                </p>

            <h2>24 March 2025</h2>
            <h3>Significant Events</h3>
            <ul class="sigEvents-list">
                <li>Completed the Basic CSS module of the freeCodeCamp lessons.</li>
                <li>Wrote a To-Do List by following along with a YouTube video.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Thoughts</h3>
            <div class="thought-entry">Working on the To-Do List was a good exercise. I was able to follow along and
                type the code out for the HTML
                and CSS because I already knew what the code was doing. I'm glad I didn't wait to learn Javascript
                before
                doing this.
                Walking through the js in the video was pretty easy because I already know some programming basics.
                For the values, properties, elements and other code I didn't know, I used Copilot to explain those if
                they
                didn't in the
                youtube video. Repetition and using AI to help me understand what code means will be key.
                <p>Next I will branch my repo and add the To-Do List to my site and practice merging.</p>

            <h3>Significant Events</h3>
            <ul class="sigEvents-list">
                <li>Completed the freeCodeCamp HTML course and now into the CSS.</li>
                <li>Added this journal page to track my progress.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Thoughts</h3>
            <div class="thought-entry">I know this site will benefit from understaning CSS and this page specifically
                will benefit from javascript.
                Right now the whole page is in HTML, but future entries should be able to be stored in a data file of
                some
                type.
            </div>
