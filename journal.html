    <h1>Journey to Becoming a Programmer Journal</h1>
    <p>My routinely captured thoughts to remind me what I've done and keep a record of this journey.</p>
    <p>I'm opening this part of my site on 22 March 2025.  I started self-teaching around February 2025.</p>
    <p>In terms of web development all I know is html right now, so this is a BASIC page written all in HTML till I learn more basic techniques.</p>

    <h2>22 March 2025</h2>
    <h3>Significant Events</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Completed the freeCodeCamp HMTL tutorial and now into the CSS finally.</li>
        <li>Added this journal page to track my progress.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Thoughts</h3>
    I know this site will benefit from understaning CSS and this page specifically will benefit from javascript.
    Right now the whole page is in HTML, but future entries should be able to be stored in a data file of some type.

    <h2>Up to 21 March 2025</h2>
    What I've done so far:
    <ul>
        <li>Feb-Mar '25: Learned C# basics through the freeCodeCamp and Microsoft Learn C# Fundamentals Course</li>
        <li>Mar '25: YouTube classes to learn how to use git and GitHub.</li>
        <li>Mar '25: Completed the HTML part of the freeCodeCamp full stack course.</li>
        <li>Mar '25: Started work on my first app.  The basic task tracker app in .NET using a web form application (WFA).  It was completed but data was not being saved.  I have not learned how to work with data yet.</li>
    </ul>
