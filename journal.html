    <h1>Journey to Becoming a Programmer</h1>
    <p>Routinely captured thoughts to remind me what I've done and keep a record of this journey.</p>
    <p>I opened this part of my site on 22 March 2025.  I started self-teaching around February 2025.</p>
    <p>In terms of web development all I know is html right now, so this is a BASIC page written all in 
        HTML till I learn more basic techniques.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>24 March 2025</h2>
    <h3>Significant Events</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Completed the Basic CSS module of the freeCodeCamp lessons.</li>
        <li>Wrote a To-Do List by following along with a YouTube video.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Thoughts</h3>
    Working on the To-Do List was a good exercise.  I was able to follow along and type the code out for the HTML
    and CSS because I already knew what the code was doing.  I'm glad I didn't wait to learn Javascript before doing this.
    Walking through the js in the video was pretty easy because I already know some programming basics. 
    For the values, properties, elements and other code I didn't know, I used Copilot to explain those if they didn't in the
    youtube video. Repetition and using AI to help me understand what code means will be key.
    <p>Next I will branch my repo and add the To-Do List to my site and practice merging.</p>
    <h2>22 March 2025</h2>
    <h3>Significant Events</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Completed the freeCodeCamp HTML course and now into the CSS.</li>
        <li>Added this journal page to track my progress.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Thoughts</h3>
    I know this site will benefit from understaning CSS and this page specifically will benefit from javascript.
    Right now the whole page is in HTML, but future entries should be able to be stored in a data file of some type.

    <h2>Up to 21 March 2025</h2>
    What I've done so far:
    <ul>
