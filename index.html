    <h1>Learning to be a Programmer</h1>
    <p>I learned computer programming more than 20 years ago.  After that I went into a career that did nothing with computers except for writing emails.</p>  
    <p>Now I'm trying to get back into programming because I love it and find it fun.  However I'm very behind in skills.  I'm still just learning html, css, and javascript. </p>
    <p>I'm using this website to practice frontend development and practice git and github. </p>
